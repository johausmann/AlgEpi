### How can ChIP-seq data be used to locate tissue-specifc enhancers?

### Mention approaches for differential peak calling!

## 5. Analysis of DNA methylation data

### Why does sodium bisulfite treatment allow DNA methylation analysis?

### Why is WGBS called the gold standard in DNA methylation analysis?

### Why is bisulfite-seq data difficult to analyze?

### What is the asymmetric mapping problem?

### How do reduced representation mappers perform alignment?

### What are PMDs and how does MethylSeekR find them?

### How does RnBeads do differential methylation detection?

### Why is epigenetics on cell-free DNA interesting?

## 6. Analysis of open-chromatin data

### What does open-chromatin mean?

### Which assays are commonly used to profile open-chromatin regions?

### How is NOMe-seq different to other assays?

### What is the underlying idea of the gNOMeHMM approach for?

### How does JAMM use mixture models for detecting peaks?

### Which aspect of ATAC-seq data is specifically modelled by the HMM in the HMMRATAC method?

### Which of the two assays are more similar ATAC-, NOMe- and, DNase1-seq and why?

### How can you compute overlap between peak datasets?

* Since peaks are just intervalls of genomic regions you can use BEDtools
to intersect the region to find overlaps
