## 1. Introduction into Epigenetics

### What is epigenetics?

* studies on heritable changes
  + of gene expression
  + of cellular phenotype
  
* caused by mechanisms other than changes in the nucleotide sequence

### What happens in DNA methylation?

* methylation of the 5th C-atom of cytosine
  + 5-Methylcytosine

* occurring in the CpG context
  +   both strands of the DNA are recognized and methylated

* dynamic process
  + active methylation (_de novo_: DNMT3a/b, conservation: DNMT1)
  + de-methylation (TET1/2/3, BER)


![Methylation – De-methylation path of cytosine](media/lecture1_methylation.jpg){width=50%}

* DNA methylation is also used to define the parental strand during replication

### How can DNA methylation affect gene expression?


* CpG islands are cytosine and guanin rich regions in the genome

* conserved region in or close to the promoter

* unmethylated = gene is active
  + TF can bind &rarr; gene is expressed

* methylated = gene is silenced
  + TF can not bind &rarr; gene not expressed
  
* Methylated DNA can interfere (block or enhance) the binding of
transcription factors

* methyl binding proteins
  + recognize methylated CpG sites
  + recruit histone modifying enzymes &rarr; chromatin changes


### What are histone modifcations?

* DNA is wrapped around Histones (protein of a certain type)
  + DNA + core histones &rarr; nucleosome

* Addition of H1 (linker histone) &rarr; 30nm fibre (less active genes)

* Biochemical modifications of core histones
  + influence affinity of linker histone (H1)  
  &rarr; consequence is change in chromatin structure  
  

* Histone tails (N-terminal) get modified
  + position and type influence the outcome (activation or repression of transcription)
  
![Type of histone modifications and naming convention](media/lecture1_histone_modification.jpg){width=50%}


### Which histone modifications are associated with active transcription or heterochromatin?

* Acetylation of histones at N-terminal ends is associated with transcriptional activity

* Lysins in terminal ends lead to positive charge that interacts with negative charge of DNA
  
* Acetylated lysins reduces positive charge
  + Loss of affinity to DNA

* Change of charge also effects interaction of nucleosomes among each other
    + Loss of 30nm filaments
    
* Good overview: [Link to overview table (https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-019-1870-5)](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-019-1870-5/tables/1)


### What is Waddington‘s epigenetic landscape model?

* 1957: Conrad Waddington's concept of an epigenetic landscape to represent the process of cellular decision-making during development. At various points in this dynamic visual metaphor, the cell (represented by a ball) can take specific permitted trajectories, leading to different outcomes or cell fates.

* Dellular differentiation can be considered an epigenetic phenomenon, largely governed by changes in “epigenetic landscape” rather than alterations in genetic inheritance

![Waddington's Classical Epigenetic Landscape](media/lecture1_waddington.jpg){width=50%}


* Chromatin structure of germ cells loosened and DNA
methylation is reduced to a minmum &rarr; totipotent cell types

* cell-type specific pattern established in following cell division cycles &rarr; cell-type specific gene expression

### What is imprinting?

* Allele-specific expression of a genev (either from the maternal or paternal allele) via CpG methylation

### Explain how mosaic colouring of cat fur comes about?

* Random activation or inactivation during embryonic development of one of the X chromosomes, where the responsible gene for fur coloring is located

## 2. Understanding gene expression with RNA sequencing

### What is RNA-seq?

### How to obtain RNA counts?

### Why do we need to normalize RNA-seq read counts?

### What are TPM and RPKM normalization?

### Why is TPM better?

### How to quantify transcript expression?

### What is the effective length of a transcript?

### Which biases does Salmon take into account?

## 3. Analysis of differential expression data and interpretation

### Which normalization does DEseq2 use?

### What is the advantage of the negative binomial compared to the Possion distribution, when looking at counts?

### What is a p-value?

### What does FDR mean

### Why do I need to do FDR?

### How does DEseq2 fit the dispersion for genes?

### What is an MA-plot, and how to read it?

### What is the Gene Ontology?

### How is functional enrichment estimated?

## 4. Analysis of ChIP-seq data

### What is ChIP-seq?

### Why do we need to normalize ChIP-seq read counts?

### What is indirect binding?

### Explain basic quality steps for ChIP-seq data?

### How does peak calling with MACS2 work?

### What are the 6 core histone modifications?

### How can ChIP-seq data be used to locate tissue-specifc enhancers?

### Mention approaches for differential peak calling!

## 5. Analysis of DNA methylation data

### Why does sodium bisulfite treatment allow DNA methylation analysis?

* Treatment of DNA with bisulphite &rarr; reaction converts unmethylated cytosines to uracils, methylated cytosine (5-methylcytosine) does not react with bisulphite.

* During PCR uracil becomes thymine

### Why is WGBS called the gold standard in DNA methylation analysis?

* Cytosine methylation across the entire genome at single base resolution

* Unbiased

### Why is bisulfite-seq data difficult to analyze?

* Up to four DNA strands have to be analysed

* Mapping
  * increased search space (more positions, where sequence can map)
  * heterogenicity of methylation levels of individual CpGs in profiled cell populations ([Link to article](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkaa120))

### What is the asymmetric mapping problem?

![Asymmetric mapping problem](media/lecture5_asymmetric.png){width=70%}

* bisulfite treatment: unmethylated cytosines are converted to thymines during the PCR amplification

* This conversion must be take into account during alignment by allowing an asymmetric mapping
  * thymine in a read mapped to a cytosine in the reference genome sequence &rarr; match 
  * thymine in the genome sequence mapped to a cytosine in a read &rarr; mismatch.

### How do reduced representation mappers perform alignment?

* Convert C to T in both reference and read

* After the conversion conduct mapping with "normal" mapper (e.g. Bowtie)

### What are PMDs and how does MethylSeekR find them?

* Partially methylated domains (PMDs) are characterized by highly disordered methylation, resulting in an average methylation clearly below the genomic background level

* generally large &rarr; do not need to be modeled at the single CpG level (summarised using sliding window)

* MethylSeekR uses sliding window of 101 CpGs

* Calculate &alpha; values (model reads covering each CpG as being generated from beta binomial distribution)
  * &alpha; < 1: favor polarized methylation close to 0 or 1
  * &alpha; > 1: biased to intermediate methylation (~0.5)

### How does RnBeads do differential methylation detection?

### Why is epigenetics on cell-free DNA interesting?

## 6. Analysis of open-chromatin data

### What does open-chromatin mean?

### Which assays are commonly used to profile open-chromatin regions?

### How is NOMe-seq different to other assays?

### What is the underlying idea of the gNOMeHMM approach for?

### How does JAMM use mixture models for detecting peaks?

### Which aspect of ATAC-seq data is specifically modelled by the HMM in the HMMRATAC method?

### Which of the two assays are more similar ATAC-, NOMe- and, DNase1-seq and why?

### How can you compute overlap between peak datasets?

* Since peaks are just intervalls of genomic regions you can use BEDtools
to intersect the region to find overlaps
