## 1. Introduction into Epigenetics

### What is epigenetics?

* studies on heritable changes
  + of gene expression
  + of cellular phenotype
  
* caused by mechanisms other than changes in the nucleotide sequence

### What happens in DNA methylation?

* methylation of the 5th C-atom of cytosine
  + 5-Methylcytosine

* occurring in the CpG context
  +   both strands of the DNA are recognized and methylated

* dynamic process
  + active methylation (Dnmt)
  + de-methylation (Tet)

### How can DNA methylation affect gene expression?


* CpG islands are cytosine and guanin rich regions in the genome

* conserved region in or close to the promoter

* unmethylated = gene is active
  + TF can bind &rarr; gene is expressed

* methylated = gene is silenced
  + TF can not bind &rarr; gene not expressed

* methyl binding proteins
  + recognize methylated CpG sites
  + recruit histone modifying enzymes &rarr; chromatin changes


### What are histone modifcations?

* DNA is wrapped around Histones (protein of a certain type)
  + DNA + core histones &rarr; nucleosome

* Addition of H1 (linke histone) &rarr; 30nm fibre (less active genes)

* Biochemical modifications of core histones
  + influence affinity of linker histone (H1)  
  &rarr; consequence is change in chromatin structure  
  

* Histone tails (N-terminal) get modified
  + position and type influence the outcome (activation or repression of transcription)

### Which histone modifications are associated with active transcriptionor heterochromatin?

* Acetylation of histones at N-terminal ends is associated with transcriptional activity

* Lysins in terminal ends lead to positive charge that interacts with negative charge of DNA
  
* Acetylated lysins reduces positive charge
  + Loss of affinity to DNA

* Change of charge also effects interaction of nucleosomes among each other
    + Loss of 30nm filaments


### What is Waddington‘s epigenetic landscape model?

### What is imprinting?

### Explain how mosaic colouring of cat fur comes about?

## 2. Understanding gene expression with RNA sequencing

### What is RNA-seq?

### Which biases does Salmon take into account?

## 3. Analysis of differential expression data and interpretation

### Which normalization does DEseq2 use?

### What is the advantage of the negative binomial compared to the Possion distribution, when looking at counts?

### What is a p-value?

### What does FDR mean

### Why do I need to do FDR?

### How does DEseq2 fit the dispersion for genes?

### What is an MA-plot, and how to read it?

### What is the Gene Ontology?

### How is functional enrichment estimated?

## 4. Analysis of ChIP-seq data

### What is ChIP-seq?

### Why do we need to normalize ChIP-seq read counts?

### What is indirect binding?

### Explain basic quality steps for ChIP-seq data?

### How does peak calling with MACS2 work?

### What are the 6 core histone modifications?

### How can ChIP-seq data be used to locate tissue-specifc enhancers?

### Mention approaches for differential peak calling!

## 5. Analysis of DNA methylation data

### Why does sodium bisulfite treatment allow DNA methylation analysis?

### Why is WGBS called the gold standard in DNA methylation analysis?

### Why is bisulfite-seq data difficult to analyze?

### What is the asymmetric mapping problem?

### How do reduced representation mappers perform alignment?

### What are PMDs and how does MethylSeekR find them?

### How does RnBeads do differential methylation detection?

### Why is epigenetics on cell-free DNA interesting?

## 6. Analysis of open-chromatin data

### What does open-chromatin mean?

### Which assays are commonly used to profile open-chromatin regions?

### How is NOMe-seq different to other assays?

### What is the underlying idea of the gNOMeHMM approach for?

### How does JAMM use mixture models for detecting peaks?

### Which aspect of ATAC-seq data is specifically modelled by the HMM in the HMMRATAC method?

### Which of the two assays are more similar ATAC-, NOMe- and, DNase1-seq and why?

### How can you compute overlap between peak datasets?

* Since peaks are just intervalls of genomic regions you can use BEDtools
to intersect the region to find overlaps
